# Crispy Chicken Parm

[Original Recipe](https://youtu.be/p-LY9b1u_io)

While the original recipe includes directions for a sauce, I have chosen to omit them. I did not care
for the sauce. Plus, I often find it not worth the effort or time to make sauce when compared to ready-made
purchasable sauce.

The chicken is _delicious_. Can be eaten without sauce and pasta. Very good taste, just be sure not burn it while frying.

## Ingredients

* 2 chicken breasts
* 4 garlic cloves
* 1 shallot
* White wine (to taste)
* Flour (depends on chicken size/amount)
* 1/4 cup of Panko bread crumbs *per piece of chicken*
* 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese *per piece of chicken*
* 2 eggs

**Note**
Original recipe calls for 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs and cheese, but I had a _ton_ left over.
I'd suggest going for a smaller amount and see how that works. Can always add more.

## Preparation

* Cut your  chicken breasts in half, length-wise.
* Pound chicken into similar thickness.
* Season both sides with salt and pepper.
* Dice 5 cloves of garlic.
* In a bowl, add the chicken, about 1/3 of the garlic, and 1 tbsp white wine
* Mix in bowl, place in fridge. Leave for 30 minutes minimum.

## Cooking Instructions

### The Sauce
* Just use store-brand sauce.
* `optional` Add some garlic, onion, peppers, etc tp the sauce.
* Bring sauce to simmer.

### Pasta
* Cook some pasta.

### The chicken
* Prepare three bowls:
  * One with flour
  * One with panko bread crumbs + cheese. Mix well.
  * One with beaten eggs
* Take chicken out from fridge.
* Dry chicken on papertowel.
* Cover the chicken in flour, then egg(s), then the breadcrumb+cheese mixture. 

### Frying
* In a pan, heat some olive oil at medium heat
* Add seasoned chicken breast.
* Reduce heat if needed; we want a light sizzle.
* Flip chicken when golden; usually in 3 minutes.
* Cook until golden on both sides, or pull off at 165 degrees internal.
* Drain on cooling rack
