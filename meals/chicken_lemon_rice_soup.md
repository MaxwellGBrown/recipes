# Chicken Lemon Rice

[Original Recipe](https://momtomomnutrition.com/food-and-recipes/chicken-lemon-rice-soup/)

Not the most visually appealing recipe, but when made right it can be very tasty.
A very simple chicken lemon rice recipe, where the hardest part is waiting for the rice to cook.

Do not be afraid to add more/less lemon to fit your preference. I often have to add more lemn juice.

## Ingredients

* 4 cups chicken broth
* 1/2 cup uncooked white rice
* 4 tbsp lemon juice
* 2 eggs
* 2 cups shredded chicken (1-2 chicken breast)

## Preparation

* Mix the eggs and lemon juice in a bowl.
* Separatly, shred chicken.

## Cooking Instructions

* Add broth to pot, bring to boil.
* Rinse rise in a strainer under cold water.
* Reduce heat to low, then add rice.
* Simmer for 20 minutes, then remove from heat.
* *Slowly* add egg/juice mixture to rice; whisk constantly and do 1 tbsp at a time so egg does not cook.
* Stir in cooked chicken until warm.
